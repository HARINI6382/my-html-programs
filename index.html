    <h2>About:</h2>
    <p><b>Cricket</b> is a very popular game and is played at both national and international levels. This game originated in England. Cricket was introduced to the Indians by the British in the early 1700s. This game rules in everyone's heart in India and so it can be called the <i><b>“king of the games”</b></i>.
    <br>
    <p>Cricket is played with a <u>bat and ball</u> and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. As there are 11 players on a team and 2 of them must be the bowler and wicketkeeper, only 9 other positions can be occupied at any one time.</p>
